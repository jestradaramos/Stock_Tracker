# Stock_Tracker
Learning to use API's with D3 and random JS. Lol. Lets see how this goes. 

### What it do?

Currently this project only takes in a stock symbol and shows the max value of the 
stock for the past couple months. 

#### Currently it lacks:  
- The ability to refresh the data each time I insert a new stock  
- The ability to process the data quickly  
- The option for a user to select the dates they want the stock  
- The ability to compare stocks on top of each other (kind of)  
- A decent UI  
- The ability to process live data  
- Resizing  

#### Potential Things to add: 
- Multiple stocks on one graph
- Graphs side by side
- Show growth as a percentage rather than amount in $
- One the side have a list of Stocks that have been looked at
- On the Bottom some fact about the company (Another API?)
- Different graph views (Show high and low of each day)
