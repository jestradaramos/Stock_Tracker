# Stock_Tracker
Learning to use API's with D3 and random JS. Lol. Lets see how this goes. 

### What it do?

Currently this project only takes in a stock symbol and shows the max value of the 
stock for the past couple months. 

Currently it lacks:
	- The ability to refresh the data each time I insert a new stock
	- The ability to process the data quickly
	- The option for a user to select the dates they want the stock
	- The ability to compare stocks on top of each other (kind of)
	- A decent UI
	- The ability to process live data
	- Resizing
